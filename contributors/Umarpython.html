  <h3>Olowonyo Umar</h3>
  <p>Hello world ðŸ‘‹! My name is Umar and I like to code. I also love mathematics. I can say that I am addicted to it. I initially wanted to study medicine to become a doctor. The main reason why I wanted to do that was because I had a small disability when I was younger. I had a bow-leg; so, I had surgery then my legs were straight. Then I thought it would be nice to become an orthopedic surgeon to help children that would be like me. But sadly,I just lost interest. I thought it required a lot of cramming(and I don't like cramming); so, I dropped it. Thennnnn, I found out about CS. My brother is a computer guy too so I just thought CS would be nice. I realised that I am young and that I can do ANYTHING that I want to do. So, I just thought of doing CS. Well, that's me.</p>
